# DIY-Arduino-based-Guitar-Pickup-Coil-Winder
This is mini Arduino based machine to wind guitar pickup coil.

Hello friends in this post I have made a simple mini 
arduino based guitar pickup coil winding machine. 
Winding hundreds of turn with hand is quite boring & time consuming job.
so I build this mini machine,
I have used two stepper motors in this project and HMI for user interface.
and I have used a multipurpose PCB for this project.

## VIDEO ##
First of all please watch the complete video I have shown there
